Machine learning on Text
====================

## Requirements

1. use k-NN to build a page classifier and evaluate it
    - Apply any semi-supervised learning approach (e.g., PU-learning) to improve your classifier in (1)
2. use k-mean and hierarchical clustering to cluster pages you selected

### Note

1. in (1), you should think about your classification and label the ground truth manually. You can define any features and class you want,e.g., spam/useful
2. in (1), apply a cross-validation on your classification
3. in (1)(2), you should analysis effects from different k (if applicable).
